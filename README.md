# Rootest README file

An absolute link early on in the file: <http://www.sourceforge.net>

*Here* is some documentation.

# Second heading

Here is some more content.

And now we attempt to [link](ANOTHER.md)

[SubDir](subdir) is a sub-project.

How are artifact links rendered? [subdir]

Another link test: [subdir]()

This causes lots of problems:

    [](subdir)

Url syntax: <subdir> And some text afterwards.

And some more text afterwards.
